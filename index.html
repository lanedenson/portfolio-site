        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Lane Todd Denson, Senior Manager of Web Development with extensive experience in leading digital strategies, UX, technical SEO, and front-end development for global organizations. Currently, I oversee all web development initiatives at United Methodist Communications, where my team manages multiple high-traffic websites across platforms like Sitecore, WordPress, and ExpressionEngine, generating over 20 million pageviews annually. My passion for improving user experience and site performance is demonstrated in my work, where I've driven a 65% improvement in page load times and boosted Lighthouse metrics by 25%.</p>

        <p>As a certified Professional Scrum Product Owner I and Professional Scrum Master I, I apply agile scrum methodologies to manage product backlogs, sprint grooming, and web development workflows. My role involves close collaboration with stakeholders to align development projects with strategic business goals while fostering innovation within the team. I'm always looking to streamline processes, leveraging AI-based automation to reduce manual tasks and increase efficiency across the board.</p>
        
        <p>With a strong technical foundation, I bring hands-on expertise in front-end development, using HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript to enhance user experiences. I’m equally skilled in cloud computing, media production, and digital asset management, having produced high-profile live streaming events and overseen digital media transitions for organizations. My comprehensive skill set includes managing SEO and analytics through tools like Google Analytics, SEMRush, and Google Tag Manager, ensuring continuous improvement in web performance and marketing efforts.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond web development, I’ve led digital media projects that have significantly impacted audience engagement, including managing multimedia content and livestreaming for global conferences.  I’m also passionate about emerging technologies, as seen in my recent exploration of AI-driven tools for indexing website content and enabling interactive user experiences.</p>
        
        <p>With a strong foundation in digital strategy, UX, SEO, and performance optimization, I’m always eager to take on new challenges that push the boundaries of what’s possible in web development.</p>
